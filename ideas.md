#idea and lets talk big this time

Just for smash ultimate, if 0.5% of all people who bought smash ultimate play competitively, that means 150k people
play smash ultimate competitively (0.5% of 30 million). Just for ultimate, not including melee.
Mix that in with other games, Street figher, tekken, etc. and we could maybe have something.


# Current
We don't get many people on the website (like we had 19 today lmao). So the goal right now is to just
get more people to the WEBSITE.

Heres some ideas:

•Follow the top 100 players on twitter and do some indirect advertising (like replying to when they need to find
tournaments)
•Go to tournament organizers, ask them how it is, questions about how people find their tournaments and show them my website and ask
them to share it so people can find their tournaments easier. (and perhaps incentives like special animation)
• Go to in-person tournaments and tell them to advertise.
•Post on new sites like reddit, threads, discord servers, tik tok. Maybe even a new twitter post.
•Go directly to top players and tell them to advertise me lmaooo.
•Make a twitter bot that tweets out when a tournament is happening (and maybe even @s the tournament organizer)
•look into maybe google advertising
• Search for people looking for tournaments


# IN THE FARRR FUTURE
We would have some decent viewerbase at this time. At this moment, we should look into creating our own tournament
hosting system, with the incentives being (special features like a certain number of advertising, and the fact
that more people would be using my site meaning more viewership). As well, maybe even a very small fee to start
in which that incentive would be some benefits and the fact that being with me means more viewership means more money for them.

We should look into even our own tournaments being run, smash mapping tournaments if you wanna call it that.
Start running our own "e-sports" leagues/circuits. Get into contact with people to know how this runs first.

Basically we want to be the main goto hub person for not just smash but e-sports as a whole.

Just know that the skys the limits and we have something special here.


# Features
• Special animation if a tournament has a top 100 player (and maybe more animations if tournament has numerous top
100 players)
• More games, like overwatch, league of legends, fortnite (and changee the name up at that point)
• Paid advertising (either like a board at the top that shows tournaments, and/or special icon animation)
• "Drag and search" where someone can select a radius and drag around to search within that area
• City Search with a radius selector (this might use up a lot of tokens so consider a "city database")
• Account system (useful to get this set up now rather than later) (apply benifits)
• Perhaps more countries
• get that stupid domain fixed (smashmapping.com)
• Special icons for certified majors
• Help screen for TO's.
• Discord server (if we get big)
• Country tags for supabase
• Schedules for big tournaments (maybe even a list of the big tournaments on the map)
• Animation for special marker (event listener for when marker is "on screen"?)
• fix stupid bug with multiple markers on same spot
• Different markers for different games

JUST THINK BIG
