    to attend. What I found out was that there was extreme difficulty finding in person tournaments, there was no way
    to just &quot;see&quot; tournaments in your area. I eventually found my local scene but that difficulty always stuck with me.

    At Smash Mapping, the goal is to make finding in-person tournaments far easier than current methods. Smash Mapping
    physically maps tournaments that are listed on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.start.gg/" class="svelte-joqoq1">Start.gg</a> so you
    can easily see what tournaments are near you. By using the filters, you can easily search for tournaments that you
    specifically want, when you want. <br class="svelte-joqoq1"/><br class="svelte-joqoq1"/>


    But this doesn&#39;t only help individuals looking for tournaments, it also helps <b class="svelte-joqoq1">tournament organizers</b>. The
    whole reason why its so hard to find tournaments is because organizers don&#39;t have a good way to show their
    tournaments to the public. Hopefully, if Smash Mapping becomes widespread, tournament organizers won&#39;t have to worry
    about advertising tournaments, people can just use Smash Mapping and find it themselves. Easy! <br class="svelte-joqoq1"/><br class="svelte-joqoq1"/> <b class="svelte-joqoq1">Smash Mapping is currently in beta, so there may (and probably will) be bugs. If you find any, please report them
